Adobe Palette Swatch ASE to XML Converter

Adobe introduced a proprietary color palette swatch format: 
Adobe Swatch Exchange.  These Adobe Swatch Exchange (ASE) files 
allowed designers to share palettes across Adobe products but 
did not publish the file format.

In 2008, I reverse-engineered the ASE file format and 
published my online swatch conversion tool now hosted at:

In 2015, I open-sourced the app as ASE2XML on GitHub.
