# ASE2XML
Adobe Palette Swatch ASE to XML Converter

Sometime around 2006
Adobe  introduced a proprietary color palette swatch format: 
Adobe Swatch Exchange.  These Adobe Swatch Exchange (ASE) files 
allowed designers to share palettes across Adobe products but 
did not publish the file format.

In 2008, I reverse-engineered the ASE file format 
(documented here: http://carl.camera/default.aspx?id=109) and 
published my online swatch conversion tool now hosted at:

In 2013, I open-sourced the Microsoft .NET web app as ASE2XML on GitHub.
In 2017, I updated the web app to display the colors on screen rather
than create the Microsoft Expression Desgin XML file. The source code to do so
remains for those interested.
